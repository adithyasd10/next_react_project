# Next.js Hotel Info App 🏨

This is my **first Next.js project**, built as part of a frontend certification course. The app fetches hotel data from a public API and displays hotel listings in a modern layout using server-side rendering with Next.js 13+.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Built with **Next.js App Router**
- 🌐 Fetches hotel data from external API
- ⚡ Server-side rendering with `async` functions
- 📦 Clean project structure and modular components
- 🎯 Ideal for beginners learning modern React frameworks

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Working with the new **App Router** (`app/` directory)
- Using `async`/`await` with `fetch` in server components
- Styling with modular CSS
- Committing and pushing real-world projects to GitHub
- Handling Git merge conflicts & deploying clean code

## 🔧 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adithyasd10/next_react_project.git
